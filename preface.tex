\chapter*{Preface}

This document was created in preparation for the prelim exam in 2025, and was a collaborative effort among the students taking it that year.

The goal of this document is to provide a compact summary of the most important concepts from each of the core graduate-level astronomy courses at UW--Madison. It does not contain exam prep materials like practice problems. Nor is it an exhaustive list of the subject matter that is ``fair game'' for the prelim. It is simply meant to be used as a sort of map for studying.

This document is not meant to be read passively. Syllabi for the core astronomy courses change on an annual basis, and the original authors of this document cannot account for what new material has been cut out of or introduced to these courses since we took them. It therefore falls to the reader to be mindful of the differences between the content herein described and that covered in their own classes.
